# Hello Amigoscode
Welcome to your HTML Essentials course. We've adapted Section 3: Fundamentals to showcase what is possible with [Teachstack](https://www.teachstack.io).

We've done our best to adapt the course as faithfully as possible. In many cases we've added some new explainatory text and simple exercises to check comprehension. We have made the first three lessons unskippable, so you must complete the exercise to proceed. The rest you can click through at your leisure.

We attempted to embed the Vimeo videos for each stage of the course, but presumably you prevent these assets from being embeded anywhere else except for the Amigoscode domain. It is however possible to embed media into the instructional content.

While this is a relatively simple course, our platform allows the integration of more complex programming languages, including Java, C# and C++. We can also integrate various database technologies, such as SQL and MongoDB.

Please get in touch with any feedback by emailing dominic.jackson@teachstack.io, or using the [contact form](https://teachstack.io/contact) on our website.
