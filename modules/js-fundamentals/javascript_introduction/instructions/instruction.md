# Hello Amigoscode
Welcome to your JavaScript for Beginners course. We've adapted Section 3: Fundamentals to showcase what is possible with [Teachstack](https://www.teachstack.io).

We've done our best to adapt the course as faithfully as possible. In many cases we've added some new explainatory text and simple coding exercises to check comprehension at each stage. We have made the first three lessons unskippable (i.e. you must complete the exercise to progress to the next lesson). The remainder of the lessons you can click through at your leisure.

We attempted to embed the Vimeo videos for each stage of the course, but presumably you prevent these assets from being embeded anywhere else except for the Amigoscode domain. Below I've embeded the JavaScript Crash Course video you made several years ago from YouTube to showcase the potential for embeding media content. This section of content you are reading can be edited using markdown text augmented by HTML.

While this is a relatively simple course, our platform allows the integration of far more complex programming languages, including Java, C# and C++. We can also integrate various database technologies, such as SQL and MongoDB, if you want to teach more advanced topics using multiple technologies and frameworks.
